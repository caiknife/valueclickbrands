      <h2>Did You Know About Online Coupons? </h2>
      <p>Did you know that you could save money almost every time you shop online
        by using <a onclick="top.MyClose=false;" href="http://www.couponmountain.com/Consumer_Electronics_all.html">online
        coupons</a>? Most people don&#146;t.</p>
      <p>Next time you buy something online, take a careful look as you take your
        shopping cart through the checkout process. If you see, &#147;enter your
        coupon or gift certificate here&#148;, you&#146;ve found an online merchant
        that uses online coupons. A quick search at CouponMountain.com can tell
        you if we&#146;ve found any coupons or special promotions for that retailer
        at this time. We can also tell you what, if any, restrictions are on those
        coupons. And even if you don&#146;t find a coupon for the online merchant
        you want to shop at, you might find another online store where you can
        buy the same item for less.</p>
      <h2><br>
        What Is An Online Coupon?</h2>
      <p>The most popular online coupons are clickable and can be redeemed online.
        As the name implies, you click on the coupon and are taken to the website
        of the online merchant. Usually you will be given a specific coupon code
        (e.g. SAVE20) which must be entered during the checkout process at the
        online merchant to receive a discount, or the coupon value will be automatically
        entered into the shopping basket.</p>
      <p>There are also printable coupons available online. These are usually
        printed on your laser printer and then taken to a merchant&#146;s physical
        store for redemption. We have found it easier to use clickable coupons
        for online merchants, and not found a great source of valuable local coupons.
        When we do, we will post them on CouponMountain.com</p>
      <h2>Where Can I Find Online Coupons?</h2>
      <p>Simply type www.couponmountain.com into the address bar of your browser,
        and you&#146;ll be taken to our home page.</p>
      <p>If you are more interested in browsing coupons for a general shopping
        category, click on a category link. From there you can select the coupon
        or promotion that best matches your interest.</p>
      <p>Each coupon will include whenever possible:</p>
      <p>The offer amount or savings <br>
        The restriction or terms of conditions <br>
        The dates during which the offer is valid <br>
        To redeem a coupon or offer that meets your interest, simply click on
        &#147;use this coupon&#148;, and you will be taken to the merchant&#146;s
        web site. A CouponMountain.com window will pop up with the coupon code,
        and a link to the restrictions if any. For our most popular merchants,
        we will also offer a link to demonstrate where to enter the coupon code
        during the merchant&#146;s checkout process.<br>
